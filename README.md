# machine-architecture-and-organization
All projects from my Machine Architecture and Organization class

Project 1 - Had it where you input some text and outputs the same text in a different font. Also had numerous functions that related to binary search trees and adding to a tree or traversing through it. 

Project 2 - Displayed a temperature input through the use of bit shifting. 

Project 3 - The same as project 2, but it is all converted to x64 assembly. 

Project 4 - Optimized given matrix multiplication code and found out differences in search times through different structures like linear searches through an array and binary searches in a tree.

Project 5 - Displayed content of an ELF file.
